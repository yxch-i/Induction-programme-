# My Expereience at GNDEC

## DAY 1                             DATE 30th July 2025

My first day at GNDEC started with a gathering at college Gurudwara Sahbeh with Shabad Kirtan. Whare students from different branches sat together to start their post graduation with the name of god. After that all the students were served snacks with tea, the tea that was being served was good. Then all the students gathered in the auditorium, where some of us meet Harpreet Mam for the first time and she was our first speaker of the day who not only motivated us but made us feel welcome with her kind and sharp words. 

Our principal sir then motivated us to make the best out the platform that we were on. Then the programme started with showcasing the histoy of the college, emphasizing its 68 years of shaping brilliant minds. She highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

Next, an ex-MLA came on the stage, who shared his life experiences that how he became a lawyer and then at the age of 28 practiced fluency in english and motivated us to not be ashamed of the circumstances but rather to make the best out of them. One line that he shared which his father told thim after him graduation about being an engineer, he said and I quote: "Even the lines drawn with closed eyes should be straight". Which speakes about the idea of the perfection one can/should achieve in his/her selected field. 


## DAY 2  

Second day at the institution started with settling down in the auditorium. Our first speaker of the day was Dr. Priya Darshni Mam who spoke on the topic "Universal Human Values". She while sharing very valuable knowledge also kept the lecture interesting which is not an easy task but she made it seem like a piece of cake. She interacted with students, heard student problems gave them solutions and also knowledge and guidance on how to get to the solution themselves. Overall it was a nice experience. 

Other speaker of the day was Dr. Arvind Dhingra, he had a kind, energetic and interactive personality. He helped me shed my reserved behavior and start interacting with others. He asked for 6 boys and 6 girls to came on the stage and then the students played a game mainly focusing on thier coorddination and after that were treated with sweets. And after some more expert knowledge and wisdom filled words. He asked for another set of students and played another game. It was a mood lifting programme other than the fact it took all of the break time. 

After the expert lectures, we had tests of english and maths. Which were conducted by seniors. The english test was easy and was completed by almost all under 40 mins. On the other hand students some  what struggled  with maths test. My test went good and it was a nice back on track experience.
