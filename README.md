# My Expereience at GNDEC

## DAY 1                             DATE 30th July 2025

My first day at GNDEC started with a gathering at college Gurudwara Sahbeh with Shabad Kirtan. Whare students from different branches sat together to start their post graduation with the name of god. After that all the students were served snacks with tea, the tea that was being served was good. Then all the students gathered in the auditorium, where some of us meet Harpreet Mam for the first time and she was our first speaker of the day who not only motivated us but made us feel welcome with her kind and sharp words. 

Our principal sir then motivated us to make the best out the platform that we were on. Then the programme started with showcasing the histoy of the college, emphasizing its 68 years of shaping brilliant minds. She highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

Next, an ex-MLA came on the stage, who shared his life experiences that how he became a lawyer and then at the age of 28 practiced fluency in english and motivated us to not be ashamed of the circumstances but rather to make the best out of them. One line that he shared which his father told thim after him graduation about being an engineer, he said and I quote: "Even the lines drawn with closed eyes should be straight". Which speakes about the idea of the perfection one can/should achieve in his/her selected field.
